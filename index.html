<p> My favorite Pet is my cat TomTom. I love our cat because he is so cute and so kind. I remember that every night, he was in bed earlier than me. We also spent a few years with him. But last time November, our cat suddenly disappeared. Until now we have not been able to find him. Even though that happened, we still have the memories of TomTom in our hearts. </p>
